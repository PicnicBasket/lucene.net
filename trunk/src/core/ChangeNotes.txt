This branch does not build, and likely won't for a while. The
tests don't pass, and there is no guarantee that everything
would work properly even if it did.  There is a bit of work
being done to try and emulate java's classes as much as possible
and because of that, there may be unexpected behavior until
tests have been written and prove that they work as intended.

TODO: Tests need to be written for SupportClass.HashMap
TODO: Tests need to be written for SupportClass.WeakHashMap -> the entire implementation is probably all wrong

Util.Version changed to Enum with extension methods
ThreadInterruptedException.java was not ported, because it only exists in the java because the build-in is a checked exception
RamUsageEstimator unsure how to port.  Moves seen Dict to a Dict<object,object> (seemingly pointless), but java sets the Map<object,object> as a new IdentityHashMap()
PriorityQueue in InsertWithOverflow, java returns null, I set it to return default(T).  I don't think it's an issue, it looks like java is doing unchecked generics.  We should look back and determine if we should contrain the generic to class
Parameter.cs - Commented code in Lucene.Net is uncommented in java
TODO: Finish HashMap<K,V> and confirm it properly emulates java's behavior
TODO: NamedThreadFactory.java
TODO: DummyConcurrentLock.java
TODO: Constants.java - LUCENE_MAIN_VERSION, and static constructor
TODO: AverageGuessMemoryModel.java - IdentityHashMap okay to change to Dictionary<k,v>?
TODO: AttributeSource.java needs WeakHashMap<k,v> ported from java
TODO: Implement Cache.cs' IDisposable properly
TODO: Check on FSDirectory(System.IO.DirectoryInfo path, LockFactory lockFactory)
TODO: Revisit rewriting in ThreadInterruptedException
TODO: LockStressTest.java
TODO: MMapDirectory.java -> ThreadInterruptedException
TODO: NIOFSDirectory.java
TODO: RAMDirectory.java
Util, Store (All files touched - Any that are present in 3.0.3 still need to be added)
TODO: BooleanClause.java - Can't override tostring on Enum.  Leave type-safe or override with extension method?
TODO: FieldValueHitQueue.Entry had to be made public for accessibility.  Look further into that.
TODO: ParallelMultiSearcher - uses a lot of the java concurrency libs, which don't have perfect .NET equivalents
TODO: FuzzyQuery - uses java.util.PriorityQueue<T>, which .net does not have.  Revisit later.
TODO: ParallelReader - extra data types, TreeMap<Tk,Tv>

TODO: SegmentInfos inherites from Vector<E>, which is threadsafe.  Closest equivelant is SynchronizedCollection<T> in .NET, but it's in a System.ServiceModel, and I can't be sure it's worth a dependency on that entire assembly for the one class.  Thread safety can probably be achieved in a different way.

TODO: ThreadInterruptedException.java - This shouldn't be necessary.  Lucene is using it because it is unchecked.  C# has no checked expcetions
TODO: FSDirectory.java - ThreadInterruptedException
TODO: ConcurrentMergeScheduler - ThreadInterruptedException

CHANGED: FieldCacheRangeFilter - Expects nullable primitives for the anonymous range filters<T> -> replaced with Nulable<T>
CONFIRM: IndexWriter.java - ReaderPool.Close/Commit/Get lock/sync changes - may be wrong - ThreadInterruptedException(ie)

				<p>Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C# and targeted at .NET runtime users. Lucene.Net has three primary goals:
					<ul>
						<li>Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize with the Java Lucene release schedule.</li>
						<li>High-performance C# search engine library.</li>
						<li>Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that takes advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h2>Incubation</h2>
				<p>Apache Lucene.Netâ„¢ is an effort undergoing incubation at <a href="http://www.apache.org/">The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</a>, 
				sponsored by the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator</a>. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects 
				until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner 
				consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or 
				stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

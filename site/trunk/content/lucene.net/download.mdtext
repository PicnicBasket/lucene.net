# Cutting Edge

At the moment, we are preparing the 2.9.4 version for general release in our trunk, 
and we also have an extensive effort underway to '.Net-ify' Lucene.Net under the 2.9.4g
branch.

- [2.9.4g - .Net'ified](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/lucene.net/branches/Lucene.Net_2_9_4g/) - Continually evolving to provide a more standard .Net experience

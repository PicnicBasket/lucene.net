**Latest Release - Lucene.Net 2.9.2**


These are official releases that are stable and should be relatively free of bugs:
	
  - Binary
  - Source

	
Cutting Edge

This is the latest and greatest, we do our best to keep it stable, but occasionally 
it won't build correctly. Newer features will likely not work as intended, 
and even older features might be broken temporarily

<h2>Lucene.Net</h2>

Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C# and targeted at .NET runtime users. Lucene.Net has three primary goals:

  - Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to C#, fully automating and commoditizing the process such that the project can easily synchronize with the Java Lucene release schedule.
  - High-performance C# search engine library.
  - Maximize usability and power when used within the .NET runtime. To that end, it will present a highly idiomatic, carefully tailored API that takes advantage of many of the special features of the .NET runtime.</li>

<h2>Incubation</h2>

Apache Lucene.Netâ„¢ is an effort undergoing incubation at <a href="http://www.apache.org/">The Apache Software Foundation (ASF)</a>, 
sponsored by the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/">Apache Incubator</a>. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects 
until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner 
consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or 
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.

Title: Apache Lucene.Net

# Apache Lucene.Net
## Overview

Lucene.Net is a port of the Lucene search engine library, written in C# and 
targeted at .NET runtime users.

Lucene.Net has three primary goals:

 1. Maintain the existing line-by-line port from Java to
    C#, fully  automating and commoditizing the process such that the
    project can easily  synchronize with the Java Lucene release
    schedule. 
 2. High-performance C# search engine library. 
 3. Maximize usability and power when used within the
    .NET runtime. To that end, it will present a highly idiomatic,
    carefully tailored API that takes advantage of many of the special
    features of the .NET runtime.

You can find the Lucene parent project at: [http://lucene.apache.org/][1]

In January 2011, Lucene.Net was [proposed][2] as a candidate for entry into the 
[Apache Incubator][3] with the purpose restarting the project with a new set 
of goals and committers. Prior to that, Lucene.Net had been developed as a 
subproject of Lucene.  Lucene.Net's incubation status is tracked at 
[http://incubator.apache.org/projects/lucene.net][4].

    (lucene-net-user at incubator dot apache dot org). 
-   If you'd like to contribute to Lucene.Net or follow updates to Lucene.Net's issue 
    tracker, please [subscribe][12] to the [Lucene.Net developers mailing list][13] (lucene-net-dev at incubator dot apache dot org).

## Issue Tracker

You might find a bug (sorry!), or have an idea for a new feature (no problem!), or have a code patch to contribute (thanks!). All Lucene.Net issues are [tracked][19] using Apache JIRA. If you aren't sure whether something is a bug, post a question on the Lucene.Net user mailing list.

Note that to create a new issue or comment on an existing one you'll have to [sign up for an account][20].

## Development 

Lucene.Net is an on-going project that is under active development. Below you'll find resources such as our roadmap, instructions on how to build the source, coding guidlines, and much more.

### Source Repository

Anonymous SVN URL: [https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/lucene.net/trunk][9]

### Committers

If you have a question about the source, it's best to use the development mailing list to ask your question. However, if you need to contact one of the committers directly they are listed here (alphabetically):

-   Chris Currens (currens.chris AT gmail DOT com)
-   DIGY (digydigy AT gmail DOT com)
-   Michael Herndon (mherndon AT wickedsoftware DOT net)
-   Prescott Nasser (prescott.nasser AT hotmail DOT com)
-   Scott Lombard (lombardenator AT gmail DOT com)
-   Sergey Mirvoda (sergey AT mirvoda DOT com)
-   Troy Howard (thoward37 AT gmail DOT com)

### Roadmap 

#### Next Scheduled Binary Release
-   **Lucene.Net 2.9.2 (Anticipated Release Date: 02/28/2011)**

#### Backlog
-   **Full automated port using Sharpen (2nd quarter 2011)**

    Our current process of porting is a manual one involving a lot of man hours, and isn't repeatable by the general public. We'd like to see that change, and so we're working on creating build scripts which will automate the entire process of porting from Java to .NET using various tools like Sharpen to accomplish this. Ideally, an end user could grab the latest souce code release, then, using the build script and following the instructions provided, convert the equivalent Java Lucene release to .NET source, and then compile that source to create a binary build. This is a lofty goal, but the closer we can get to this, the better. This will be an ongoing project, but we hope to get our first release of this out sometime in the 2nd quarter of 2011.

-   **Lucene.Net 3.0.2 (2nd quarter 2011)**

    This release will match the API and functionality of the [Lucene 3.0.2][21] release. 

-   **Lucene.Net .NET Idiomatic API (2nd/3rd quarter 2011)**
    
    This project is focused on developing an API that is idiomatic to .NET code. This is a departure from our previous philosophy of only doing a direct API port from the Java code. We're very interesting in your opinion about how this should be designed, so please join the mailing lists and let us know what you'd like to see in this API! 

-   **Lucene.Net .NET Optimized Implementation (3rd/4th quarter 2011)**
    
    This project is focused on refactoring the implementation of the code to be highly optimized for the .NET runtime. The original port was a line-by-line port of the Java code, and was done in a manner consistent with Java development for the JVM. There are subtle, but important differences between the JVM and the .NET CLR, and we hope that by refactoring the implementations, we'll be able to improve overall performance, but at least make the code more sensible as native C# code!


### Build Instructions and Coding Guidelines 

*TODO: Please come back later for more details.*

Basic instruction are simply download the source, the latest copy of Visual Studio (the free Express version will be fine), open the solution and click 'Build'. If that doesn't work for you, send a message to the development mailing list!

## Disclaimer

Apache Lucene.Netâ„¢ is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the [Apache Incubator][3].  Incubation is
required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that
the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have
stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While
incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully
endorsed by the ASF.
